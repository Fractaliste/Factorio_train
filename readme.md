# Refueling
This mods auto skip station named "Plein" (it's configurable le since 0.16.3) if it does not need refueling, and auto redirect to "Plein" station when refueling is needed.

Since 0.16.3 you don't need anymore to manually initiate to your train a station schedule to "Plein" station, it is automatically added (and removed) when needed.
